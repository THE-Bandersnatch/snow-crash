# Snow Crash - CTF Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions and walkthroughs for the Snow Crash security challenge (42 School project).

## 📚 About

Snow Crash is a beginner-friendly security challenge that teaches:
- Basic cryptography
- Password cracking
- Network analysis
- Binary exploitation
- System security concepts

Each level introduces a new security concept or vulnerability. My notes document the thought process, tools used, and solution approach for each challenge.

## 🎯 Structure

Each level has its own directory with:
- `flag` - The token/flag obtained for that level
- `resources/README.md` - Detailed walkthrough and notes

## 📝 My Approach

These README files contain my actual notes taken while solving each challenge - including:
- Initial confusion and dead ends
- Tools and commands I tried
- The thinking process that led to the solution
- Key concepts learned along the way

Feel free to use these as reference, but I'd recommend trying to solve the challenges yourself first!

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're doing the Snow Crash challenge:
1. Set up the VM (SnowCrash.iso)
2. Start from level00 and work your way up
3. Each level builds on concepts from previous ones
4. Read the subject PDF for full instructions

## 📁 Levels Completed

- [x] Level 00 - Caesar Cipher
- [x] Level 01 - Password Hash Cracking
- [x] Level 02 - Network Traffic Analysis
- [x] Level 03-14 - (See individual level directories)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These are my personal notes and solutions. If you're doing this challenge for 42 School, make sure you understand the concepts rather than just copying solutions!
