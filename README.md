# Snow Crash - CTF Challenge Solutions

My solutions and notes for the Snow Crash security challenge (42 School project).

## About

Snow Crash is a beginner-friendly security challenge covering cryptography, password cracking, network analysis, binary exploitation, and system security concepts.

Each level introduces a new security concept. My notes document the approach, tools used, and solutions.

## Structure

Each level directory contains:
- `flag` - The token/flag for that level
- `resources/README.md` - Walkthrough and notes

## My Notes

These README files are my actual notes from solving each challenge - tools tried, thought process, solutions, and concepts learned.

Use as reference, but try solving the challenges yourself first!

## Getting Started

If doing the Snow Crash challenge:
1. Set up the VM (SnowCrash.iso)
2. Start from level00 and work your way up
3. Each level builds on previous concepts
4. Read the subject PDF for instructions

## Disclaimer

These are my personal notes and solutions. If doing this for 42 School, understand the concepts rather than just copying solutions!
